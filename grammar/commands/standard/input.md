# Syntax

Much like the print statement, this accepts one argument, what to ask.

```python
input(<thing to print>)
```

NOTE: This is also the same as the Python input

# Examples

```python
let x: string = input("What do you want x to be?")
```

This prints "What do you want x to be?" to the console, asks for user input and then assigns the input to x.

```python
let name: string = "What's your name?"
print(name)
```

This asks for the users name, and then prints it back to them.
