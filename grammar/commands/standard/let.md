# Syntax

Let declares a variable with the arguments of name, type, and value respectively.

```rust
let <var name>: <var type> = <value>
```

These types are i32, i64, f32, f64, bool, and string.

NOTE: This is much like the Rust syntax except you do not have to specify it being mutable, because let is the keyword for mutability.

# Examples

To declare a variable x with a value of 4, you would type

```rust
let x: i32 = 4
```

This sets up the variable x as a 32 bit integer with a value of 4.

To declare a string variable, y, with a value of "Hello, World!" you would run

```rust
let y: string = "Hello, World!"
```
