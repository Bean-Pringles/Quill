# Syntax

Print accepts one argument, the item to print.

```python
print(<item to print>)
```

NOTE: The for print syntax is the exact same as Python

# Examples

```python
let x: string = "World!"
print("Hello,")
print(x)
```

This will print "Hello," on one line and "World!" on a separate line.

```python
const x: i32 = 4
print(x)
```

This will print "4" to the console.
