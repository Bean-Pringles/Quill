# Syntax

This imports a library and allows you to use it's commands in the program.

```python
import <library name>
```

NOTE: The import syntax is the exact same as the Python

# Examples

```python
import os
```

Allows any command from the os library to be ran from then on.

```python
os.clrscr()
import os
```

This would error on line 1 because os was not imported before this command was called.
